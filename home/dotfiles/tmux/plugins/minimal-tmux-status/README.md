## Usage

## Installation via Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM)

I recommend using [Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) for easy installation:

1. Add the theme to your list of TPM plugins in your `~/.tmux.conf`:

   ```bash
   set -g @plugin 'niksingh710/minimal-tmux-status'
   ```

2. Press `prefix` + <kbd>I</kbd> (capital "i", as in Install) to fetch and install the plugin.

3. Reload your Tmux configuration:

   ```bash
   tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
   ```

That's it! Your Tmux Status Theme is now installed and ready to use.

## Tip

Add this line in your tmux config so that you can easily toggle tmux status bar with one keymap.
```
bind-key b set-option status
```
Now pressing `prefix+b` will toggle status bar
